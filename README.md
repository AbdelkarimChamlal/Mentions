# Mentions
The idea of this project is a **one platform** to collect all mentions from multiple platforms. display them & save them for later check.

this will make it simple to see all tags and mentions in one place. across multiple platforms.

For now I mainly want to start with Dev platforms such as Github & Slack.

## Technologies

Backend: Laravel since I think it can work for this project by using it to create a RESTful API.
Frontend: Not sure yet. there are many JS libraries and frameworks I want to try so not sure yet.
