# Mentions
The idea of this tool is to allow users "developers at this moment" to have a platform where they can connect they "Github account, Slack..." and what ever platforms they use in the workplace. 
the platform will collect notifications and mentions that they are taged in. and save them.
this way nothing gets skipped and the user can go back and check what he missed.
plus since the new added mentions are placed in the mentions column. the user can see what is new and what is old.
